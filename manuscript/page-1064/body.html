<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This Land of Fire forms a huge cluster of islands over thirty leagues long and eighty leagues wide, extending between latitude 53 degrees and 56 degrees south, and between longitude 67 degrees 50' and 77 degrees 15' west. Its coastline looked flat, but high mountains rose in the distance. I even thought I glimpsed Mt. Sarmiento, whose elevation is 2,070 meters above sea level: a pyramid-shaped block of shale with a very sharp summit, which, depending on whether it's clear or veiled in vapor, "predicts fair weather or foul," as Ned Land told me.</p><p>"A first-class barometer, my friend."</p><p>"Yes, sir, a natural barometer that didn't let me down when I navigated the narrows of the Strait of Magellan."</p></div> </div>
