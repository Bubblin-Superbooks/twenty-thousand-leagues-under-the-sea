"Have you made some discovery that has escaped me? Has the sea yielded up some novel secret to you?"</p><p>We were miles apart. But before I could reply, he showed me a manuscript open on the table and told me in a more serious tone:</p><p>"Here, Professor Aronnax, is a manuscript written in several languages. It contains a summary of my research under the sea, and God willing, it won't perish with me. Signed with my name, complete with my life story, this manuscript will be enclosed in a small, unsinkable contrivance. The last surviving man on the Nautilus will throw this contrivance into the sea, and it will go wherever the waves carry it."</p></div> </div>
