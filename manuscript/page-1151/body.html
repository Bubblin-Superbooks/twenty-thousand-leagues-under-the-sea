While the Nautilus was clearing a path through their tight ranks, Conseil couldn't refrain from making this comment:</p><p>"Mercy, look at these cod!" he said. "Why, I thought cod were flat, like dab or sole!"</p><p>"Innocent boy!" I exclaimed. "Cod are flat only at the grocery store, where they're cut open and spread out on display. But in the water they're like mullet, spindle-shaped and perfectly built for speed."</p><p>"I can easily believe master," Conseil replied. "But what crowds of them! What swarms!"</p><p>"Bah! My friend, there'd be many more without their enemies, scorpionfish and human beings! Do you know how many eggs have been counted in a single female?"</p></div> </div>
