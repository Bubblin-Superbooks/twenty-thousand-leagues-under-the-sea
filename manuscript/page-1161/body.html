No flag was flapping from the gaff of its fore-and-aft sail, and I couldn't tell its nationality.</p><p>A few minutes before the sun passed its zenith, Captain Nemo raised his sextant and took his sights with the utmost precision. The absolute calm of the waves facilitated this operation. The Nautilus lay motionless, neither rolling nor pitching.</p></div> </div>
