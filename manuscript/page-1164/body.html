Was it something other than a maritime accident that had dragged this craft under the waters?</p><p>I wasn't sure what to think, but next to me I heard Captain Nemo's voice slowly say:</p><p>"Originally this ship was christened the Marseillais. It carried seventy-four cannons and was launched in 1762. On August 13, 1778, commanded by La Poype-Vertrieux, it fought valiantly against the Preston. On July 4, 1779, as a member of the squadron under Admiral d'Estaing, it assisted in the capture of the island of Grenada. On September 5, 1781, under the Count de Grasse, it took part in the Battle of Chesapeake Bay. In 1794 the new Republic of France changed the name of this ship.</p></div> </div>
