Some fifteen of the Nautilus's seamen surrounded their captain and stared with a feeling of implacable hate at the ship bearing down on them. You could feel the same spirit of vengeance enkindling their every soul.</p><p>I went below just as another projectile scraped the Nautilus's hull, and I heard the captain exclaim:</p><p>"Shoot, you demented vessel! Shower your futile shells! You won't escape the Nautilus's spur! But this isn't the place where you'll perish! I don't want your wreckage mingling with that of the Avenger!"</p><p>I repaired to my stateroom. The captain and his chief officer stayed on the platform. The propeller was set in motion.
