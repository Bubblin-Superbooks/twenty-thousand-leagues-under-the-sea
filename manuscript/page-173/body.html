We've gotten out of tighter spots. So please do me the favor of waiting a bit before you form your views on the commander and crew of this boat."</p><p>"My views are fully formed," Ned Land shot back. "They're rogues!"</p><p>"Oh good! And from what country?"</p><p>"Roguedom!"</p><p>"My gallant Ned, as yet that country isn't clearly marked on maps of the world, but I admit that the nationality of these two strangers is hard to make out! Neither English, French, nor German, that's all we can say. But I'm tempted to think that the commander and his chief officer were born in the low latitudes. There must be southern blood in them. But as to whether they're Spaniards, Turks, Arabs, or East Indians, their physical characteristics don't give me enough to go on. And as for their speech, it's utterly incomprehensible."</p></div> </div>
