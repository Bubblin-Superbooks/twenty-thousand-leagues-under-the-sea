Captain Nemo replied. "Did your study at the museum afford you such a perfect retreat?"</p><p>"No, sir, and I might add that it's quite a humble one next to yours.

But I was done with the shore the day my Nautilus submerged for the first time under the waters. That day I purchased my last volumes, my last pamphlets, my last newspapers, and ever since I've chosen to believe that humanity no longer thinks or writes. In any event, professor, these books are at your disposal, and you may use them freely."</p></div> </div>
