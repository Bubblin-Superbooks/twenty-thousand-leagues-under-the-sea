<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I followed Captain Nemo down gangways located for easy transit, and I arrived amidships. There I found a sort of shaft heading upward between two watertight bulkheads. An iron ladder, clamped to the wall, led to the shaft's upper end. I asked the captain what this ladder was for.</p><p>"It goes to the skiff," he replied.</p><p>"What! You have a skiff?" I replied in some astonishment.</p><p>"Surely. An excellent longboat, light and unsinkable, which is used for excursions and fishing trips."</p><p>"But when you want to set out, don't you have to return to the surface of the sea?"</p></div> </div>
