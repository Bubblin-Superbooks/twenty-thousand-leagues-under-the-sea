I asked quickly, hoping the captain's reply might give me a clue to his nationality.</p><p>"Sir," he answered me, "I have chronometers variously set to the meridians of Paris, Greenwich, and Washington, D.C. But in your honor, I'll use the one for Paris."</p><p>This reply told me nothing.

At noon on this day of November 8, we hereby begin our voyage of exploration under the waters."</p></div> </div>
