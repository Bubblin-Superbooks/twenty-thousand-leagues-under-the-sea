<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Just maybe, Conseil."</p><p>"And how about the subdivisions of these two large classes?"</p><p>"I haven't the foggiest notion," the Canadian replied.</p><p>"All right, listen and learn, Ned my friend! Bony fish are subdivided into six orders. Primo, the acanthopterygians, whose upper jaw is fully formed and free-moving, and whose gills take the shape of a comb. This order consists of fifteen families, in other words, three-quarters of all known fish. Example: the common perch."</p><p>"Pretty fair eating," Ned Land replied.</p><p>"Secundo," Conseil went on, "the abdominals, whose pelvic fins hang under the abdomen to the rear of the pectorals but aren't attached to the shoulder bone, an order that's divided into five families and makes up the great majority of freshwater fish. Examples: carp, pike."</p></div> </div>
