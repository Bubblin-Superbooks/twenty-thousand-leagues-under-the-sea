<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"First let's look into this Crespo Island."</p><p>I consulted the world map; and in latitude 32 degrees 40' north and longitude 167 degrees 50' west, I found an islet that had been discovered in 1801 by Captain Crespo, which old Spanish charts called Rocca de la Plata, in other words, "Silver Rock." So we were about 1,800 miles from our starting point, and by a slight change of heading, the Nautilus was bringing us back toward the southeast.</p><p>I showed my companions this small, stray rock in the middle of the north Pacific.</p><p>"If Captain Nemo does sometimes go ashore," I told them, "at least he only picks desert islands!"</p></div> </div>
