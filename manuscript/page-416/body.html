I was busy tracing the Nautilus's course on the world map. The captain approached, placed a finger over a position on the chart, and pronounced just one word:</p><p>"Vanikoro."</p><p>This name was magic! It was the name of those islets where vessels under the Count de La PÃ©rouse had miscarried. I straightened suddenly.</p><p>"The Nautilus is bringing us to Vanikoro?" I asked.</p><p>"Yes, professor," the captain replied.</p></div> </div>
