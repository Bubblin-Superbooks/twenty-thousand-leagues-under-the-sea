Nevertheless, I'm counting on your dexterity to catch me one of these delightful representatives of tropical nature!"</p><p>"I'll give it a try, professor, though I'm handier with a harpoon than a rifle."</p><p>Malaysians, who do a booming business in these birds with the Chinese, have various methods for catching them that we couldn't use. Sometimes they set snares on the tops of the tall trees that the bird of paradise prefers to inhabit. At other times they capture it with a tenacious glue that paralyzes its movements. They will even go so far as to poison the springs where these fowl habitually drink. But in our case, all we could do was fire at them on the wing, which left us little chance of getting one. And in truth, we used up a good part of our ammunition in vain.</p></div> </div>
