"They make counterfeit birds of paradise?"</p><p>"Yes, Conseil."</p><p>"And is master familiar with how the islanders go about it?"</p><p>"Perfectly familiar. During the easterly monsoon season, birds of paradise lose the magnificent feathers around their tails that naturalists call 'below-the-wing' feathers. These feathers are gathered by the fowl forgers and skillfully fitted onto some poor previously mutilated parakeet. Then they paint over the suture, varnish the bird, and ship the fruits of their unique labors to museums and collectors in Europe."</p><p>"Good enough!" Ned Land put in.
