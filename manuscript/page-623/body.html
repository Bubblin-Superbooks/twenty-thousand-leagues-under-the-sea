Now then, those Testacea capable of producing pearls include rainbow abalone, turbo snails, giant clams, and saltwater scallops--briefly, all those that secrete mother-of-pearl, in other words, that blue, azure, violet, or white substance lining the insides of their valves."</p><p>"Are mussels included too?" the Canadian asked.</p><p>"Yes! The mussels of certain streams in Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Saxony, Bohemia, and France."</p><p>"Good!" the Canadian replied. "From now on we'll pay closer attention to 'em."</p><p>"But," I went on, "for secreting pearls, the ideal mollusk is the pearl oyster Meleagrina margaritifera, that valuable shellfish. Pearls result simply from mother-of-pearl solidifying into a globular shape. Either they stick to the oyster's shell, or they become embedded in the creature's folds. On the valves a pearl sticks fast; on the flesh it lies loose.</p></div> </div>
