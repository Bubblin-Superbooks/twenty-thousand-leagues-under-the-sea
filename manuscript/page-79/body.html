The harpooner's family originated in Quebec, and they were already a line of bold fishermen back in the days when this town still belonged to France.</p><p>Little by little Ned developed a taste for chatting, and I loved hearing the tales of his adventures in the polar seas. He described his fishing trips and his battles with great natural lyricism. His tales took on the form of an epic poem, and I felt I was hearing some Canadian Homer reciting his Iliad of the High Arctic regions.</p><p>I'm writing of this bold companion as I currently know him.
