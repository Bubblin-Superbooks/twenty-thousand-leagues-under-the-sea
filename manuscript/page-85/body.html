Ned asked.</p><p>"Because it takes incalculable strength just to live in those deep strata and withstand their pressure."</p><p>"Oh really?" Ned said, tipping me a wink.</p><p>"Oh really, and I can prove it to you with a few simple figures."</p><p>"Bosh!" Ned replied. "You can make figures do anything you want!"</p><p>"In business, Ned, but not in mathematics. Listen to me. Let's accept that the pressure of one atmosphere is represented by the pressure of a column of water thirty-two feet high. In reality, such a column of water wouldn't be quite so high because here we're dealing with salt water, which is denser than fresh water. Well then, when you dive under the waves, Ned, for every thirty-two feet of water above you, your body is tolerating the pressure of one more atmosphere, in other words, one more kilogram per each square centimeter on your body's surface.</p></div> </div>
