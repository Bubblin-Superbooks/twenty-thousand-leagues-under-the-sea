Our course was set for the northwest, and the next day our frigate's propeller finally churned the waters of the Pacific.</p><p>"Open your eyes! Open your eyes!" repeated the sailors of the Abraham Lincoln.</p><p>And they opened amazingly wide. Eyes and spyglasses (a bit dazzled, it is true, by the vista of $2,000.00) didn't remain at rest for an instant. Day and night we observed the surface of the ocean, and those with nyctalopic eyes, whose ability to see in the dark increased their chances by fifty percent, had an excellent shot at winning the prize.</p></div> </div>
