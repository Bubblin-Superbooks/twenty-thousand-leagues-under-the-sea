<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Several times that day, the Nautilus repeated the same experiment and always it bumped against this surface that formed a ceiling above it. At certain moments the ship encountered ice at a depth of 900 meters, denoting a thickness of 1,200 meters, of which 300 meters rose above the level of the ocean. This height had tripled since the moment the Nautilus had dived beneath the waves.</p><p>I meticulously noted these different depths, obtaining the underwater profile of this upside-down mountain chain that stretched beneath the sea.</p><p>By evening there was still no improvement in our situation. The ice stayed between 400 and 500 meters deep. It was obviously shrinking, but what a barrier still lay between us and the surface of the ocean!</p></div> </div>
