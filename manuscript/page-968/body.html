<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The South Pole</p><p>I RUSHED UP onto the platform. Yes, open sea! Barely a few sparse floes, some moving</p><p>icebergs; a sea stretching into the distance; hosts of birds in the air and myriads of fish under the waters, which varied from intense blue to olive green depending on the depth. The thermometer marked 3 degrees centigrade. It was as if a comparative springtime had been locked up behind that Ice Bank, whose distant masses were outlined on the northern horizon.</p><p>"Are we at the pole?" I asked the captain, my heart pounding.</p><p>"I've no idea," he answered me. "At noon we'll fix our position."</p></div> </div>
